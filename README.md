# Argentina_PCA_Kmeans

This project was meant to take a basic set of sociodemographic indicators of Argentina's provinces to apply an unsupervised learning model to clasify them.

First, PCA is applied to identify the features' relation. Then, a K-means model is trained to classify the provinces.

This exercise could be useful to identify possible different outcomes of a public policy on Argentina's provinces given their different social context.

Exercise modeled from DataCamp projects.
